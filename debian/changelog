libgatbcore0 (1.3.0-1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Correction of the required CMake version.
  Since Debian Jessie uses CMake 3.0.2 and that there is no strict justification
  for the use of 3.1.0; appart from a requirement of hdf5 that is documented in
  a patch file.

  * Fix linker settings to force the full inclusion of hdf5, pthread, libz
  symbols in libgatbcore.
  Without that, the linker flag -Wl,-z,defs (specified in debian/rules file)
  will stop the compilation, avoiding problems at runtime.

  * Add a full SONAME to the library.
  Here it is the version 0 of the API.

  * Add the rules to compile libgatbcore in shared AND static versions.
  
  * Tools are compiled with dynamic version of the lib (and with -flto flag).
  gatb-h5dump is still linked with static hdhf5 lib (like libgatbcore).
